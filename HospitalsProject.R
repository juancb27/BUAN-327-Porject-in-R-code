#SIMPLE REGRESSION
# Assuming "hospitals" is your data frame and "Beds" is the chosen variable
regression_model <- lm(Total.Expense ~ Beds, data = hospitals)

#What is the value of the R^2?
summary(regression_model)$r.squared

#What does the R^2 measure in this case? 
##An R-squared of 0.60 means that 60% of the variation in total expense can be explained by the number of beds, while 40% remains unexplained.
    
#What are the pvalues? How many pvalues are reported, why? What does each pvalue mean?
summary(regression_model)
## p-value is < 2.2e-16, other p-values are 0.00688 and < 2e-16 for both the Intercept and Beds.
##intercept: Assesses the statistical significance of the intercept term.
##Beds: Assesses the statistical significance of the "Beds" variable's effect on total expense.

#Explain R square, pvalues.
##R-squared: Measures goodness of fit, indicating how well the model explains the relationship between variables.
##P-value: Measures statistical significance, indicating the likelihood that an observed relationship is due to chance.

#What would be the right attribute size (independent variable) that seems most appropriate to lead you in the expense range of $55â€“$75 million?

summary(regression_model)
summary(regression_model)$r.squared
#An R-squared of 0.14 means that 14% of the variation in total expense can be explained by the number of beds, while 86% remains unexplained.
#p-value: < 2.2e-16
#P-Values:0.03972, 0.97249, 0.06586, 0.48329, 0.89905, 0.74725, 0.33687, 0.32606, 0.84290, 0.72469, 0.76076, 0.74073, 0.60718, 0.62720, 0.01083, 0.00101, 0.02204, 0.32989.   
#Each independent variable in the model will have its own coefficient and corresponding p-value.
#The p-values help you assess the generalizability of the observed relationships between variables in your sample data to the broader population of hospitals. A low p-value suggests the relationship is unlikely to be due to chance in the sample and increases confidence that it might hold true in the population. The population is the entire group of hospitals we are using to get our findings. 
#The low p-values suggest statistically significant relationships between the corresponding variables and Total Expense, while the higher p-values indicate less conclusive evidence for a relationship.
#R-Square: approximately 14.61% of the variation in Total Expense is explained by the independent variables included in the model.
